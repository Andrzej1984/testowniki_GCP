You work for a manufacturing plant that batches application log files together into a single log file once a day at 2:00 AM. You have written a Google Cloud
Dataflow job to process that log file. You need to make sure the log file in processed once per day as inexpensively as possible. What should you do?
Change the processing job to use Google Cloud Dataproc instead.
Manually start the Cloud Dataflow job each morning when you get into the office.
Create a cron job with Google App Engine Cron Service to run the Cloud Dataflow job.
Configure the Cloud Dataflow job as a streaming job so that it processes the log data immediately.
