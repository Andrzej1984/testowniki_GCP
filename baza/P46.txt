You work for an economic consulting firm that helps companies identify economic trends as they happen. As part of your analysis, you use Google BigQuery to correlate customer data with the average prices of the 100 most common goods sold, including bread, gasoline, milk, and others. The average prices of these goods are updated every 30 minutes. You want to make sure this data stays up to date so you can combine it with other data in BigQuery as cheaply as possible. What should you do?
Load the data every 30 minutes into a new partitioned table in BigQuery.
Store and update the data in a regional Google Cloud Storage bucket and create a federated data source in BigQuery
Store the data in Google Cloud Datastore. Use Google Cloud Dataflow to query BigQuery and combine the data programmatically with the data stored in Cloud Datastore
Store the data in a file in a regional Google Cloud Storage bucket. Use Cloud Dataflow to query BigQuery and combine the data programmatically with the data stored in Google Cloud Storage.
