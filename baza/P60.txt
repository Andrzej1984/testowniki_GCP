You launched a new gaming app almost three years ago. You have been uploading log files from the previous day to a separate Google BigQuery table with the table name format LOGS_yyyymmdd. You have been using table wildcard functions to generate daily and monthly reports for all time ranges. Recently, you discovered that some queries that cover long date ranges are exceeding the limit of 1,000 tables and failing. How can you resolve this issue?
A. Convert all daily log tables into date-partitioned tables
B. Convert the sharded tables into a single partitioned table
C. Enable query caching so you can cache data from previous months
D. Create separate views to cover each month, and query from these views
