Your organization has been collecting and analyzing data in Google BigQuery for 6 months. The majority of the data analyzed is placed in a time-partitioned table named events_partitioned. To reduce the cost of queries, your organization created a view called events, which queries only the last 14 days of data. The view is described in legacy SQL.

C. Create a new view over events_partitioned using standard SQL
D. Create a service account for the ODBC connection to use for authentication
E. Create a Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) role for the ODBC connection and shared ג€eventsג€
