You are building new real-time data warehouse for your company and will use Google BigQuery streaming inserts. There is no guarantee that data will only be sent in once but you do have a unique ID for each row of data and an event timestamp. You want to ensure that duplicates are not included while interactively querying data. Which query type should you use?
Include ORDER BY DESK on timestamp column and LIMIT to 1.
Use GROUP BY on the unique ID column and timestamp column and SUM on the values.
Use the LAG window function with PARTITION by unique ID along with WHERE LAG IS NOT NULL.
Use the ROW_NUMBER window function with PARTITION by unique ID along with WHERE row equals 1.
