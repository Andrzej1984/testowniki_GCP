Your company uses a proprietary system to send inventory data every 6 hours to a data ingestion service in the cloud. Transmitted data includes a payload of several fields and the timestamp of the transmission. If there are any concerns about a transmission, the system re-transmits the data. How should you deduplicate the data most efficiency?
Assign global unique identifiers (GUID) to each data entry.
Compute the hash value of each data entry, and compare it with all historical data.
Store each data entry as the primary key in a separate database and apply an index.
Maintain a database table to store the hash value and other metadata for each data entry.
