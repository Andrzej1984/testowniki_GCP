Your software uses a simple JSON format for all messages. These messages are published to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, then processed with Google Cloud. Dataflow to create a real-time dashboard for the CFO. During testing, you notice that some messages are missing in the dashboard. You check the logs, and all messages are being published to Cloud Pub/Sub successfully. What should you do next?
Check the dashboard application to see if it is not displaying correctly.
Run a fixed dataset through the Cloud Dataflow pipeline and analyze the output.
Use Google Stackdriver Monitoring on Cloud Pub/Sub to find the missing messages.
